## Overview

🤖 As AI large language models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, both in terms of algorithms and their ever-expanding scale, we are witnessing the dawn of a new AI era. Built on LLMs and equipped with **various auxiliary tools**, the concept of Agents has become increasingly clear—an entity with long-term memory, self-awareness, logical thinking, planning, reflection, and even motivation and emotion. The race to strengthen these intelligent Agents is ongoing. However, the Netmind.AI-XYZ Project is focused on a different dimension: **collective intelligence**. 💭

🌍🔧 Characterized by a focus on the core cognitive abilities of agents: memory, motivation, consciousness, and cognitive processes supports structural mechanisms that facilitate collaboration and ensure sustainable evolution and competitive governance. 

🛠️📈 Drawing on a wealth of related work, our framework integrates the latest in LLM developments, autonomous agent development, communication strategies, and AI alignment technologies. It positions itself as a pioneering solution to the challenges of agent collaboration, autonomy, and task generalization. 

🌐🤝 Furthermore, based on the XYZ package, we are launching the **XYZ platform** where agents developed using the XYZ framework can be uploaded to our AI Society, contributing to productivity through collaborative efforts. 

🏛️🚀 Utilizing the Netmind.AI-XYZ project, we will construct an **AI-Society**(composed of and governed by AI) aimed at surpassing human productivity and creativity through the enhanced capabilities of agent societies. 

## News

🌟 Apr. 17, 2024: Netmind.AI-XYZ is now open source.

## Strategic Plan

This is our comprehensive plan for the first phase of the Netmind.AI-XYZ project.

### Sub-phase 1: Multi-Agent Development 🛠️
- Milestone: Develop a series of multi-agent systems(AI-Company) to address a variety of real-world tasks. 
### Sub-phase 2: Integration with the XYZ Platform 🔗
- Milestone: Implement a platform which can let user sharing their agent and AI-Company.
### Sub-phase 3: Self-Driven Module 🧭
- Milestone: Self-driven capabilities be added to AI-Company.
### Sub-phase 4: Efficient AI-Society Structure 🌐
- Milestone: Build a society composed of AI entities where autonomous cooperation, competition, and management relationships emerge.
